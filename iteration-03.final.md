## Iteration 03

 * Start date: Nov 20, 2019
 * End date: Dec 1, 2019

### Changes from you `product.md`

1. As a change of feature, we changed the search tab from Game, Athlete/Team and Sports to Game, Team and Athletes. The main reason is that searching by a sport individually is insufficient to filter desired information. We incorporate sport as a search parameter under tab athlete which makes it more logical.
2. Originally, both team and individual sports are searched under tab Game whereas now we separated them into different tabs and only a specific game name is searched under tab Game. We are able to generate athlete profiles and team profiles in different forms since they are now separated.
3. As a reduction of original scope, only game name can be searched under tab Game and no other parameters, such as age and sport type, can be specified to further filter the results. Instead, a dropdown will show up when user types in some keywords.
4. Both date and team name can be specified under tab Team. However, we got rid of the date parameter since it increased complexity of the search task.



### Handoff plan

We will have a handoff meeting planned on December 5th.

Before our meeting, we will deploy our latest version to our partner's server and our partner can view our latest changes on the website (http://results.sooinc.ca).

During our meeting, we will discuss both our front-end and back-end structures and explain to him about any future development plans. Then, we will invite him to fork our repository that contains this project. Now, he will have a hold of our source code and a deployed project. The access of the server and database are already in the hand of our partner, thus he has everything he needs for future development or deployment of our project.
