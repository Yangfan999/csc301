## Team Rules


**Communications:** 

Our expected communication frequency is at least three times a week. WeChat group is our main communication channel. Video calls will be made when we are in major project transition phases. When a member has made a significant change, or has found a significant problem on our project, it is his/her responsible to update his process in our WeChat group. Each member is expected to read the group chat at least once a day to keep track of any updates or the project and meeting notifications.  Members are expected to read our repository github issues for any updates.

We will email our partner when it is needed to. If the problem cannot be addressed via email, we will arrange a video call that will fit into the partner’s schedule. If it is an emergent situation, we will have to call our partner.

The partner has provided access to internal tools used by the partner for project management including Google Suites (A shared google drive), Office 365 and the partners project tracking should we require it. The partner has indicated that they are available to engage in standup meetings, and check-ins as required.

**Meetings:**
We will have weekly online meetings with our partner every Monday night at 8 pm. Weitong Luo is in charge of setting up our meetings with our Partner. During the meeting, we will use Zoom as the communication channel with our partner. For each meeting, Linyue Wu will start  a new HackMD file to document meeting minutes. An absent  member will have to explain to the Team in our WeChat group. Our group will meet at Bahen Center at 7:30pm and prepare for the meeting. Once the online partner meeting is over, we will have a 30-minute discussion about the meeting. Meeting Minutes will then be posted as a new Github Issue.

Besides partner meetings, we will have coding sessions regularly on every Sunday afternoon. The specific time will be posted in WeChat group. The purpose of these coding sessions is to allow each member to on the track of our milestones.

---

**Conflict Resolution:**
 **Conflict:** The team is split into two parts where they each insist on their own ideas
**Solution:** We will take a step back and list all the pros and cons of each method. The decision will be made in the interest of the project and our partner's requirement.

**Conflict:** One of the team members is non-responsive which severely affects the process of our project.
**Solution:** We will talk to that team member in person. If that person continues to avoid responsibilities, we will split that person's task to ensure the project goes smoothly. Then we will have to talk to the TA about the situation.

**Conflict:** One of the team members is unable to complete his tasks prior to the due date
**Solution:** We will reassign some of that person's tasks to other team members to ensure our progress is not behind. We will then talk to that team member and assign different types of tasks to that person according to his preference and abilities.

## Partner Meetings

First meeting: 2019/11/04 (virtual with partner, team members will meet at BA)
We are planning to mainly discuss the database structure with our partner as this is the core part we need to figure out to start our project. The second thing is to discuss details about partner's server as we need to deploy on it. Finally, we will propose our UI design, discuss with our partner for improvements and describe the main feature we are going to implement in this iteration.

Review meeting: 2019/11//11 (virtual with partner, team members will meet at BA)
Give the partner a quick demo of what we have done, explain to the partner what does not work and discuss, if any, questions and concerns with partner.

## Artifacts

We use github issues to document meetings and sprints, manage our task distributions, and list TODOs. During our weekly group meetings, each member will share his/her progress to make sure everyone is on the right track. We prioritize the tasks according to the main function of user stories and the main features of our project (both aspects have been discussed with our partner). Milestone will be set according to the user story that we are implementing. Tasks are assigned according to the preference, experience and strength of a member.

## Deployment and Github Workflow

**Deployment:** 
For database connection, we will use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18. The Server Type is Database Engine, and Server Name is recorded in our Google Drive. Our partner is supposed to have data in the server so we can access them using the Admin access provided by the Partner. The admin login and password are stored in our Google Drive. The database that we are using for this project is called SO_Results. If there is any connection problem, Weitong will contact our Partner for details.

Deployment: We will deploy our web page on the partner’s Server in the location of http://results.sooinc.ca/. The deploy process is as follows, we currently have the IP, FTP, username and password of this server. To deploy our project, we will ssh into the Partner’s server and use scp to transfer our web onto the server. Then, we set up Apache and run our project on the server. We will test the connection by accessing our website (66.212.174.180:81) using another computer.

**Git / GitHub workflow:** First, we use github issues to keep track of each team member's work. We have decided to use a team-dev branch for development and for each task that a team member is assigned, this member will create a new branch for this issues and work on it. After the issue is resolved, they will make a pull request to the team-dev branch. Another member will view this pull-request and resolve any merge conflicts if there is any. In this way, combined with github issues, we have constructed a workflow that everyone can follow and analyze what is done, what needs to be done.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

The User story we chose to do on this deliverable:

>As a basketball athlete who plays in the Special Olympics, I want to check my stats in certain games in order to know where my strength and/or weakness is.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Ability to specify completed game(s) by player’s name and date.
2. Ability to list the detailed stats of individual players in the game.
3. Ability to track down the stats for specific player(s) in the game.


**Goals for this user story:** Create a basic searching website. The user will input their SOid and he/she is expected to see the output of all the games that he/she has participated in. User can click into any of the games and see the full stats of that game, which includes other participants and placements.

Main Feature: Retrieve data from backend and display them nicely on our website.

**Backend:**
1. Understand our [database structure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JkAggvaxRlVv_IMJOGsrajY5cmfrqJzx/view?usp=sharing)
2. Use Python Flask to connect to our database
3. Retrieve Data and create API for the search function
4. Parse and normalize raw data to readable JSON or dict() format for front-end use.

**Frontend:**
1. Create a search bar component that has all the filter options necessary for our goal. Send to search request to the backend
2. Create a search result page that can display a list of games retrieved from the search page.
3. Create a display games component to display detailed info of a particlar game clicked by the user.

**Together:**
1. Connect the backend API with http requests.
```sequence
SearchPage->API: Search by "soid"
API->SearchResultPage: list of games
SearchResultPage-->DisplayEvent: Display this game
```

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.
1. Build a search page to support search by game, team and athlete.
*Purpose: This is a home page where for each search, users either provide a unique id or fill in the required information to get the result.*

2. Build a search result page to display all the results that satisfy the criteria defined by users in table form.
*Purpose: There will be multiple results if id is not provided. This page acts as a transfer site which direct users to a detailed result page when they click a table row.*![](https://i.imgur.com/0Wj2EpJ.png)


3. Build a detailed event display page to show every detail of a specific event result.
*Purpose: Present the desired final search result to users.*![](https://i.imgur.com/9jjcboZ.jpg)

A video demo will be made after we have full functionality of the project.
